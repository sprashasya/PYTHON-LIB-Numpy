NumPy Practice Problems in Python 3.12.4

Overview:
This repository contains a collection of practice problems focusing on NumPy, a powerful library in Python used for numerical computations. These exercises help strengthen fundamental skills in using arrays, matrix operations, and statistical methods. As part of my learning journey in Python, I am exploring key operations and functionalities provided by NumPy.

Learning Journey:
NumPy is essential for scientific computing and data manipulation. Through these exercises, I’ve gained a solid understanding of how to use arrays, perform efficient calculations, and leverage built-in functions to work with large datasets. This hands-on approach with NumPy will support my future work in data science, machine learning, and related fields.

Impact on Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence:
NumPy plays a crucial role in Data Science, Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for several reasons:

1)Efficient Data Handling:NumPy provides powerful data structures (like arrays) that allow for efficient storage and manipulation of large datasets, making it easier to perform complex mathematical operations.

2)Performance: NumPy operations are implemented in C and Fortran, enabling fast execution of mathematical computations. This speed is essential for handling large datasets commonly used in ML and AI.

3)Integration with Libraries: Many popular libraries in the data science ecosystem (such as Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn) are built on top of NumPy. Understanding NumPy is foundational for using these libraries effectively.

4)Matrix Operations: Since many machine learning algorithms rely on matrix mathematics (like linear regression, neural networks, etc.), having a solid grasp of NumPy is vital for implementing these algorithms efficiently.

5)Statistical Functions: NumPy provides a wide range of statistical functions that are important for data analysis, enabling practitioners to perform exploratory data analysis and model evaluation with ease.

Extract the last row of the matrix.
Extract the first two columns of the matrix.
Replace the second row of the matrix with zeros.

Problem 3: Mathematical Operations
Create two 3x3 matrices with random integer values between 1 and 10.
Perform element-wise addition, subtraction, and multiplication of the two matrices.
Compute the dot product of the two matrices.
Find the determinant of the first matrix.

Problem 4: Statistical Functions
Generate an array of 100 random numbers from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
Compute the mean, median, and standard deviation of the array.
Find the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the array.

Problem 5: Logical Operations
Create an array of 20 random integers between 1 and 100.
Identify the elements that are greater than 50.
Replace all elements greater than 50 with 0.
Count the number of elements that are less than or equal to 50.

Problem 6: Advanced Indexing
Create a 5x5 matrix with values ranging from 0 to 24.
Select all elements from the matrix that are greater than 10.
Create a new matrix containing only the elements that are greater than 10.

Problem 7: Broadcasting
Create a 3x3 matrix with values from 1 to 9.
Create a 1x3 vector with values [1, 0, 1].
Add the vector to each row of the matrix using broadcasting.

Problem 8: Linear Algebra
Create a 3x3 matrix with random values.
Compute the inverse of the matrix.
Verify the result by multiplying the matrix with its inverse (the result should be close to the identity matrix).

Problem 9: Array Manipulation
Create an array of 10 random integers between 1 and 50.
Sort the array in ascending order.
Find the unique elements in the array.
Find the index of the maximum value in the array.

Problem 10: Submatrix Extraction
Create a 3x3 matrix and extract a submatrix from it by selecting rows 1 and 2, and columns 1 and 2.
Create a function that takes a matrix and the top-left and bottom-right coordinates of the submatrix and returns the submatrix.
